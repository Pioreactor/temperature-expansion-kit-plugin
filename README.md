## Pioreactor Temperature Expansion Kit Plugin

This is the necessary software to use the [Pioreactor Temperature Expansion Kit](https://pioreactor.com/collections/upgrade-kits/products/temperature-pro-kit).


Follow the hardware instructions [here](https://docs.pioreactor.com/user-guide/temperature-expansion-kit), and then install this plugin.

> After installation, check that the `temperature_automation.thermostat` have been updated on all the Pioreactors with the kit installed on. The PID values should look like those in the `additional_config.ini` in this repository.
